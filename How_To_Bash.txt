which curl > /dev/null 2>&1 || {echo "Curl is not installed" >&2; return 1; }

1st - "which curl" - Checks for Curl in the linux programs
2nd - " > /dev/null 2>&1" - outputs all errors and responses off screen to the /dev/null black hole
3rd - " || " - OR command in Bash
4th - " {echo "Curl is not installed >&2; return 1; } - Echos Text to screen if error is detected, if no error appears it will simply proceed with a blank return

Conclusion: This line can be used to check for if a dependancy is installed and can be used to install it if it is found missing.
Other Use Cases:
which curl > /dev/null 2>&1 || {echo "apt install curl -y" >&2; return 1; }    # Installs curl if it is not already installed
curl github.com > /dev/null 2>&1 || {echo "Error: no internet connection" >&2; return 1; }    # Uses curl to check the status of the internet connection
ping github.com -c 2 > /dev/null 2>&1 || {echo "Error: no internet connection" >&2; return 1; }    # Uses ping to determine the status of the internet connection
